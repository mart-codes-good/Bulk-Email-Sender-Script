Multiple Email Writer Script

This Python script helps send emails with a similar structure to multiple recipients.
It reads from a recipients.csv file to get each recipient’s name, email, and context (the personalized part of the email that changes for each person).

Before you begin:

    Create a new file in the project folder called .env.

    Inside, add your email and app password exactly like this:

        My_Email=youremail@example.com
        App_Password=yourapppassword

    Save the file, the script will load these automatically. HOORAY!
    (You need a Gmail AppPassword, you can google how to get it, you do need 2fa for it)

Instructions:

    1)Open the script and go to line 55.
    Change the Subject value to whatever subject line you want (it’s originally set as "Enter your email subject here!").

    2)Draft the structure of the email body. 
    A template is already included. You can adjust spacing as needed.
    The first line may look indented in the code due to Python formatting, but it will display correctly in the email.

    3)Add your recipients to the CSV file in this format:
        id,name,email,context
    ex: 0,Josuke,locodiamond@gmail.com,"Hey! Please remember to fix my bike!"

Important:

    Keep the CSV in the correct format (id,name,email,context).

    Do not put spaces after commas. (Spaces are fine inside quotes for the context field.)

    IDs should start at 0 and increment (0,1,2,3...).

    Double-check emails are typed correctly. A malformed address will cause errors.

    If an error occurs, only the emails before the error will be sent.
    You can check the console output to see which emails were successfully delivered.

Future Updates:
    - Improved formatting (likely HTML)
    - Easier email body drafting
    - Better error handling
